 <p markdown="1"> Hi! this is the fodblog. Basically it's a site for us to collect a bunch of fodmap recipes\*.
<br>

  If you don't know what fodmap is, lucky you, you might still like some of the recipes but you won't *have* to eat *only*  them in order to stop your insides staging open revolt.

 **F**ermentable **O**ligosaccharides, **D**isaccharides, **M**onosaccharides and **P**olyols. They are a collection of poorly absorbed simple and complex sugars that are found in a variety of fruits and vegetables and also in milk and wheat. 
 
<br>
<br>
There are many resources starting to appear online that are very useful for determining what is and what is not fodmap friendly. We have started to collect these resources on our useful links page.
<br>
<br>
 If you are anyhting like us it will be a learning experience of what is safe and what is not. It can be infuriatingly inconsistent, or at least seem that way. However, we have certainly found that the more we know about the important triggers the easier it is becoming to guess whether something will be one or not. 
<br>
<br>
The recipes collected here are ones we've found to work, although it's probably safe to say everyone's triggers are a bit different. For example we've found that onion is actually not so bad (nonetheless we use onion substitutes in all recipes), although many may find it to be a huge problem. Often for baking and carbohydrates we can use gluten free recipes too, see our post on [fodmap and gluten free](https://fodblog.github.io/ingredients/gluten_free/). So, if you see recipes with something that you think is a trigger, then it's safe to say you should heed your intuition. You'll probably be right!

We cover fodmap recipes for Japanese food, Mediterranean food, Eastern European food and many many more. We have recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and tea, all fodmap compliant.\* 
<br>
<br>
The website is as much an archive for our own use as a shared resource. Do feel free to get in touch if you have comments or suggestions. One thing that would be great would be to get suggested recipes, so that the site is not restricted to our narrow culinary experience.
<br>
<br>

\*These recipes work for us, they may not work for everyone. In posts we will try to flag up any elements that could be unfriendly to some.
