This is a collection of lighter meals to have in the middle of the day. Work is one of the last places you want to be when fodmaps start kicking off. These recipes can be served hot or cold and can make an ideal packed lunch for bringing to work.

A full list of lunches can be found at [this link](https://fodblog.github.io/blog/category/lunch/).
