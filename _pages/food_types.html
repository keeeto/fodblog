<p>Here are just some of the types of food you might want to be making. We have tried to break this down sensibly, but
obviously categories are arbitrary and personal. If you want to have lemon drizzle for breakfast we won't judge you ... much.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="basics/">Basics</a></h4>
        <p>This section is looking at some very basic things that you need for a lot of our cooking.
          <a href="sample-project/">Basics</a> like garlic, onion, flour, carbs etc. </p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="sauces/">Sauces</a></h4>
        <p>Sauces form the basis of so much of cooking. Once you have a few sauces to work with you can explore with variations
        on a theme. Here we'll look at fodmap friendly staples like tomato sauce, b&eacute;chamel, velout&eacute; and many more. </p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="breakfasts/">Breakfast</a></h4>
        <p>Breakfast is definitely my favourite meal. Here's a collection of ways to start the day, from simple everyday to the lazy Saturday morning feast. </p>

        <p>These lunches are designed to be light mid-day eating and should be suitable to bring to work as a pack lunch. </p>

        <p>The main event in most culinary circles.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="teas/">Tea</a></h4>
        <p>Tea or supper depending on your geographical and social coordinates. Whatever you call it this is the meal you have in the evening if your're not going for a full on dinner ... at least that's my take on it.</p>
