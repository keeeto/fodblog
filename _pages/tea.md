"As they wait for their mothers,

to finish with lovers,

and call them inside for their tea."

*Acryllic Afternoons* **Jarvis Cocker**  

So there you have it, tea is a meal you have in the afternoon. Whatever it is you get up to before tea is your choice really, but make sure tea is a good one. It's the last meal of the day and you want to end on a high!
