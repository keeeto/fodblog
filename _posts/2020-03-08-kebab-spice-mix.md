    Behind the counter they look nervous
    But...carry on cuttin' the finest cuts of chicken from the big spinnin' stick
    Then over flies a chick, flips, snips you on the back
    You spin round on the attack, you play now

 This is a fantastic kebab spice mix. I lifted almost totally from [The Copenhagen Kitchen](http://www.mycopenhagenkitchen.com/2016/03/01/homemade-kebab-spice-mix-no-sugar/). It's not just for meat either,
use with roasting root veg, or sprinkled over a poached egg on avocado - brings a deep sweet smokey sensation to lots of meals.

    * 2 tablespoons of ground cumin
    * 1 tablespoon of ground coriander
    * 1 tablespoon of paprika (use smoked paprika if you can)
    * 1 tsp of ground cloves
    * 1 tsp of cinnamon
    * 1 tsp of cayenne pepper
    * 1 tsp of turmeric
    * 1 tsp of black pepper
    * 0.5 tsp of ginger

### Directions

* Mix and store in a jar.
