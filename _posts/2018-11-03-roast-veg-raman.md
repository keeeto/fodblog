	Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
	You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
	When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
	The ramen noodle
	
*We the people* **A Tribe Called Quest**
	
Ramen is such a great way of serving food that it seems a shame to be limited by sometime lack of good Japanese ingredients. Now, I don't love fusion food as a thing, but when it makes sense, concept-wise, to mix different types of flavour, then why no. So in this ramen recipe the flavours are a mix of the miso and soy of east asian cooking, with a more middle eastern spice combo for the autumnal roast veg, with all the veg being available fresh pretty much everywhere - just carrots, celeriac and cauliflower.

The roasted veg mix here will do for far more than the ramen, you can save it up and mix with lentils or quinoa for a fantastic cold salad. Or just warm up and dip in the coriander, cumin, fennel mix (described below too) for a great snack. Use the pickled egg described [here](https://fodblog.github.io/2018/porter-pickled-eggs/) for some extra smokey kick.
