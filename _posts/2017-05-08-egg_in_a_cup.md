Initailly people scoff at this recipe as somewhat childish. Then they try it - it is easy, simple, clean and tasty. A really smart way to start the day.

	1 egg
	500 ml water
	10 g butter
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon balck pepper
	
* Boil the egg in the water until soft to medium, I find this takes about 6 minutes from cold, but you may need to experiment, or even better get one of these fantastic egg sensors LINK.
* Take the egg out of the water and run under a cold tap for 20 seconds.
* Take the egg out of the shell, and place in a mug.
* With a spoon mash up the egg with the butter salt and pepper. Done.
