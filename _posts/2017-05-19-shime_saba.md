	Is it any wonder he affects a black cassock?
	Here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers

	Who wall up their backs against him.
	They are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts of a body.

Pickling is another method of cooking, without heat. The acidity of the vinegar has the same effect of denaturing proteins in meat and results in "cooked" flesh. When pickling it is possible to add a range of flavours to the pickle liqueur, which then infuse into the flesh of the picklee. 

This method of mackerel combines Spanish and Japanese recipes for pickling the fish. It really preserves the wonderful ocean flavour of the fish meat, whilst brining in the piquancy of vinegar and the (European) flavours added to the liqueur.
