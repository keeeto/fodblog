	So Maguire got tired
	Of the no-target gun fired
	And returned to his headland of carrots and cabbage
	To the fields once again
	Where eunuchs can be men
	And life is more lousy than savage.

I used to hate slaw ... with a passion. I would avoid anything that had been within 2 foot of a tub of slaw. I think its understandable, having been raised in a culture where slaw meant some paltry white cabbage camouflaged in a mountain of minging mayo. Because, that's the other thing, I hate the bulk properties of mayo, the way it wobbles, jiggles, sticks and slides.

But slaw is different now. Now its a delicious crispy side salad, with tonnes of great cabbages and a light unobtrusive sauce which complements, rather than conceals the flavours of its passengers. In this version horseradish brings the heat in the sauce - serve with any kind of burger, or robust fleshy fish (e.g. mackerel/sardine).

	4 cups red cabbage finely chopped
	2 cup green (York) cabbage finely chopped
	1 tablespoon chopped dill
	Green of 4 scallions finely chopped
	2 medium carrots juileinned
	2 tablespoons horseradish sauce
	
* Mix all ingredients in a bowl
* Done
