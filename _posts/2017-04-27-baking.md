title: Porridge Bread
desc: Super-easy gluten free bread.
---

This bread is really satisfying a really easy. Much gluten free baking involves highly-skilled mixing of xanthan gum and blends of flour. This couldn't be more different. Somehow porridge oats (even gluten free ones) plus yoghurt plus heat = bread. Voodoo. Optionally experiment with adding herbs and spices to vary the recipe.

	1 tub lactose free Greek yoghurt
	Gluten free porridge oats (2 yoghurt tubs)
	1 teaspoon salt
	2 teaspoons baking soda
	------
	Optional
	Tablespoon of fenugreek leaves
	2 teaspoons caraway seeds
	1 teaspoon cumin seeds
	
* Preheat the oven to 190 C
* Add the youghurt, oats, salt baking soda and any spices to a bowl
* Mix until all oats are stuck together in a single mass
* Grease the inside of a loaf tin ([how to grease a tin](https://hummingbirdbakery.com/blog/2012/05/how-to-line-or-grease-a-cake-tin/)) and line with greased graseproof paper
* Spoon the mixture into the tin
* Smooth and compact the mixture
* Cut a groove (around 1 cm deep) down the middle of the mix
* Place in the oven for 50 minutes
* Remove from the oven and tip the loaf out of the tin
* Return the loaf to the oven upside down without tin
* Bake for a further 10 minutes
* Remove the loaf - you can check if it is done by knocing on the bottom, if it sounds hollow it is done ([tips on knowing if bread is done](http://www.thekitchn.com/fresh-baked-how-to-tell-when-b-106715))
* When its done wrap it in a clean teatowl and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes
