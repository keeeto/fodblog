*We are the pigs* **Suede**

This recipe is adapted from [a Guardian food post](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/19/minced-pork-skewers-with-peanut-and-coriander-dressing-recipe-get-ahead-alex-bluett), which details an incredibly versatile pork-mince mixture, that can be used of several different delicious dishes. The noodles here are all that we have tried so far, but variations on the theme are certainly forthcoming.

Chinese five spice contains cinnamon and star anise, which gives it a lovely slightly sweet aniseed edge.  The grated ginger gives that gentle, satisfying all-down-the-throat heat and the pork provides an earthy, slightly barn-yardy full mouth flavour.
