	Well lov'd he garlic, onions, and leeks,
	And for to drink strong wine as red as blood.

*The General Prologue* **Geoffrey Chaucer**	

Not being able to cook with garlic can be one of the greatest initial challenges in fodmap cooking. Luckily, once you make a garlic extraction into oil, you have totally overcome the majority of this issue. This oil can then be used as the basis for starting to cook many of the recipes on this site.

	1 cup oil (vegetable, sunflower, olive, as you please)
	6 cloves of garlic peeled
	
* Put the oil and the garlic in a small flat-bottomed saucepan.
Heat over a medium heat.

* When the garlic starts to go deep brown (15 - 20ish minutes) remove from the heat and allow to cool.

* When cool strain the oil through a fine sieve into a sterilised jar. [Here's how to sterilise a jar.](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-sterilise-jars)

* The oil you make this way will keep for about a week in the fridge.

* Feel free to combine garlic and onion if thatâ€™s what you want. I find it gives more flexibility to do them separately, but it is more of a pain to do.
