*Mushroom* **Can**


An Easter special, this recipe features a resurrection and a revelation. Resurrection, because we thought that mushrooms were a no on the Fodmap diet. Well it turns out that not all mushrooms are equal. [This excellent post](https://alittlebityummy.com/fodmap-guide-to-mushrooms/) details the low and high Fodmap mushrooms. We also realised that mushrooms don't seem to be a problem for us, so can use any of them now. In the recipe below we use button mushrooms, but you can easily substitute for a lower Fodmap version if you are sensitive.

The revelation is that you can use tea as a stock. I learnt this from a fantastic new book I've been reading: [The Story of Tea](https://teatrekker.com/product/the-story-of-tea-a-cultural-history-drinking-guide/). Using tea provides a light, tasty and not at all greasy stock that is fantastic for an easy soup or bowl of noodles. More tea based recipes to follow ... In this recipe we used buckwheat noodles, which are also low Fodmap.
