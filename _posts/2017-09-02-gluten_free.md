Here's the problem, gluten comes from wheat. Wheat is high in the kind of short chain sugars that really set IBS insides spinning. The accepted current opinion is that these kinds of short-chain sugars (such as fructose) are not absorbed efficiently in sufferers of IBS.  So glutenous products tends to be off limits. The common mis-conception is that gluten is not Fodmap friendly, but this is actually not really the case.

Here's the 'happy' coincidence. Wheat is also high in gluten, which is a trigger for coeliac disease. Because of the prevalence of coeliac disease and the fact that it has been studied and acknowledged for many years a whole industry of gluten free alternatives has grown up. The happy part is that by negating the problems of coeliac sufferers the products are generally also fodmap friendly.
