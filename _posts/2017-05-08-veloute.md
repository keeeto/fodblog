*Some Velvet Morning* **Lee Hazelwood**

Velout√© is the French for velvet. That tells you what you need to know about the texture of this sauce, it should be as smooth as possible. Usually it features flour, but straight replacement with an all purpose gluten-free flour does the job nicely.

Store bought socks can be a problem for fodmap as they often contain stuff like onion and garlic powder. The safest bet is to make your own - see posts on making stock.

	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
	1 1/2 teaspoons gluten free all purpose flour
	1 3/4 cups chicken stock
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon black pepper
	
* Melt the butter in a flat bottomed saucepan over a medium heat.
* Add the flour and stir continuously.
* Cook for a further three minutes until the flour starts to turn beige.
* Slowly add the stock, whisking all the time to keep it smooth.
* Add in the salt and pepper and simmer for a further 10 minutes.
