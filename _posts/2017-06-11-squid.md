	I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
    (Cause a squid is just a punk) 
    Yo he deserved to lose the fight
	
*Breakdown* **De la Soul**

This recipe is an attempt to recreate on of my favourite meals of all time. In a small spit and sawdust restaurant, that I cannot remember the name of, just by Plaza Europa in Zaragoza. Walking past we noticed that the place seemed unusually busy and had some incredible grilling fish smells coming out. 

Chiperones a la plancha was one of the small plates we ordered from the typically rushed se√±ora behind the bar. It came a few minutes later, with little ceremony, served on greaseproof paper. With a little ice cold beer on the side the memory will always last. The robust flavours - fishy squid, sharp lemon, earthy garlic -; the textures - the squid chewy yet slightly melting, the thick slice of bread toasted and crispy, the sea salt crunching and the olive oil wrapping the whole package in a deliciously smooth sauce. I'd recommend Zaragoza if only for this place, but there are also many other fantastic dining experiences to be had.
