	Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head
	I'm stepping on the devil's tail
	Across the stripes of a full moon's head
	All through the bar's of a Cuban jail
	Bloody finger's on a purple knife
	Flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass
	I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife
	Admire the view from the top of the mast

*Jockey full of burbon* **Tom Waits**

I found a great allotment market down by the local canal in Bath. The guy is selling all kinds of interesting fruit and veg, picked, plucked or dug up while you wait. This week he had something called Papolo, which I have never heard of.

It turns out Papolo is also known as Indian coriander, it was what native Americans used before the introduction of coriander/cilantro by the Spanish. It has a similar floral edge to coriander, but a soapy taste at the back-end that goes on and on. I would not take this on its own, but in a salsa, it adds an aromatic edge. The raw kale gives a green feel to the whole thing.

For bread, if you can get gluten-free sourdough, I'd recommend it, but any kind of carb will do the trick. [Here](https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/food/gluten-free-sourdough) are some (quite complex) recipes for gluten-free sourdough.

I replace the Port Salut of the tea-time baked egg with cheddar for a lighter touch. Something like feta/ch√®vre could also be interesting. 


**Serves 2**

### Egg
* Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius
* Crack the egg into a ramekin dish
* Put the dish into the oven for 5 minutes
* Take the egg out - it should be starting to go white around the edges
* Put the cheese on top - add some hot sauce if you want a kick
* Return to the oven for 6 minutes

----
### Salsa
* Chop up all of the ingredients - my good friend Christopher H. Hendon once told me that the secret to a great salsa is to chop everything the same size. He's not wrong. So whatever size you feel like, pick and stick. Here I go for about 1 cm in all dimensions that count.
* Mix the chopped ingredients with olive oil and spices, done.

### Serve
* Butter the toasted sourdough and serve with the eggs and salsa on a plate.
