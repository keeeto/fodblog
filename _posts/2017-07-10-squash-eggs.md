	Rats get in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a 
	collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter . . . Imagine
	drinking that!

Remember that [porter-pickled squash](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/picklesquash/) from two weeks ago? No. Well, then prep time for this recipe is around two weeks, sorry! But believe me, that porter-pickle is worth the two weeks and more, and you can use it for a ton of other things afterwards too - I'll post more, I promise.

The flavours here are definitely a mixture of cuisines. The pickled squash was originally from a middle eastern recipe, but then the porter brought a slightly richer maltiness to the flavour. I mixed it up with some cinnamon and honey, so that it takes on a kind of north-African flavour. However you cut it's origins, this mongrel meal tastes delicious. The sour pickle and feta are offset by the honey and cinnamon, giving a satisfying sticky sweet finish, kind of like pancakes with maple syrup.

**Instructions below are per egg**

* Heat the water in a flat bottomed saucepan over high heat.
* When just on the edge of boiling, reduce the heat to low/medium and keep the water just below boiling.
* Add the vinegar.
* Crack the egg into a teacup.
* Using a spoon stir the water around in circles until you form a whirlpool.
* Pour the egg from the cup into the whirlpool.
* Cook for approximately 4 minutes (this varies depending on egg size, keep an eye on it, if it starts to float upwards it is done).

* While the eggs are poaching:
* Crumble the feta through the pickled squash
* Remove the muffins from the toaster
* Butter the muffins
* Place half a muffin in the centre of the plate
* Spoon over with half of the squash/feta mix
* Drizzle over the top with the honey

* Sprinkle over with the salt, cinnamon and paprika
