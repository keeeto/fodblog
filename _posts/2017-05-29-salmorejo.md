	yo nunca llegaré a Córdoba.
	Por el llano, por el viento,
	jaca negra, luna roja.
	I never will reach Cordoba.
	Over the plain, through the wind,
	A black nag, the bloody moon.
	
*F. G. Lorca* **Canción del jinete/The horseman's song**

Salmorejo is an Andalusian version of the popular and much more famous gazpacho. The major difference is the in salmorejo we add some bread to the mix before blending, this gives the mixture a creamier texture and more filling nature. Like gazpacho, it is served cold. Here we use [fodmap bread](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/porridge_bread/) to keep it friendly.

Salmorejo also makes an excellent sauce to serve with many tapas. One of the most memorable tapas we have had was smoked sardine served on a toasted bread with salmorejo - in the Casa Morales near the cathedral in Sevilla - washed down with a dry, fruity manzanilla sherry. 

In our home version, we served with our neighbours home pickled beer and jalepeno eggs, which added a beautiful sharp edge to the sweet smooth soup. I am going to bug them for their pickle recipe to put on the site!
