Based on the basic toamto sauce recipe. The addition of fennel is great if you are serving with pork or seafood - or both. Simple addition of fennel seeds at the start leads to a rich background aniseed flavour.

Uses the recipes for [garlic](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/garlic_oil/) and [onion](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/onion_oil/) oil presented elsewhere on this site.

	25 g butter
	2 teaspoons of fennel seed
	1 tablespoon of onion oil
	1 tablespoon garlic oil
	2 x 440 g cans of chopped tomatoes
	1 teaspoon of sugar
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
	
* Melt the butter in a flat-bottomed saucepan.
* Add the onion and garlic oils. 
* Add the fennel seeds, cook for 2 minutes.
* Add in the tomatoes, sugar, salt and pepper.
* Cook for 15 - 20 minutes for a fresh light sauce, leave for longer to achieve a deeper richer flavour.
