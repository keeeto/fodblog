A simple and completely delicious tea or lunch. It takes about 15 minutes total. Baking keeps the egg really creamy, with gooey cheese on top.

	1 Egg
	50 g Port salut sliced around 1 cm thick

* Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius
* Crack the egg into a ramekin dish
* Put the dish into the oven for 5 minutes
* Take the egg out - it should be starting to go white around the edges
* Put the cheese on top - add some hot sauce if you want a kick
* Return to the oven for 6 minutes
* Serve - this goes really well with the porridge bread or potato waffles
