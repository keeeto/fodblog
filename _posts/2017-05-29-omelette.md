	What should I say about my life? That it's long and abhors transparence. 
	Broken eggs make me grieve; the omelet, though, makes me vomit. 
	
*J. Brodsky*  **May 24, 1980**

One of the most basic of breakfasts, or indeed lunch or teas. Once you get the basic omelette down, you can start to experiment by adding all kinds of flavour to the filling or to the batter. 

	3 eggs
	2 teaspoons water/milk
	10 g unsalted butter
	1 teaspoon each salt and pepper
	
* Warm a small plate and set to the side of the hob.
* Melt the butter in a hot small frying pan, until foaming.
* Gently beat the eggs with salt and pepper and water/milk.
* Add the mix to the frying pan.
* The mix starts to cook immediately, pull the cooked edges towards the centre of the pan, tilting the pan so that the uncooked eggs run towards the edges.
* Repeat this mixing around 4-5 times.
* Continue until most of the egg is set, but the centre is still raw.
* If you are using a filling, at this point spoon it into a line down the centre of the omelette.
* To fold, flip the edge just below the handle of the pan towards the centre.
* Remove from the pan and place on the warm plate.
