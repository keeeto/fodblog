	La luna llorando dice:
	"Yo quiero ser una naranja".

	No puede ser, hija mía,
	aunque te pongas rosada.
	Ni siquiera limoncito.
	¡Qué lástima!	

	The moon weeping says
	“I want to be an orange”.

	You can’t be, my dear, 
	even if you turn pink
	or a little bit lemon
	How sad!
	
*Dos lunas de tarde (Two evening moons)* **Federico G. Lorca (trans Sarah Arvio)**

This salad is inspired by a recent trip to Andalucia. Not that any of the flavours are directly lifted, but the combination of orange and light cheese seems to fit with warm outdoor lunchtimes and long siestas. And of course the ubiquitous orange trees lining the streets could have been an influence. It is also a relatively filling but light feeling lunch time dish. After a week of large (delicious) fish lunches, this is kind of what I was craving at the end.

**Serves 2**

	* 1 can on lentils
	* 2 easy peeler oranges
	* 1 tablespoon for fresh chopped dill
	* 50 g of crumbled feta cheese
	* 1/4 cucumber chopped into 1cm cubes
	* The greens of 2 spring onions chopped fine
	* Large handful of peppery leaves (rocket/watercress etc)

	* 1/2 teaspoon of sherry vinegar
	* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
	* 3 or 4 anchovies from a can, chopped fine

* Mix all the ingredients in a bowl
* Serve - I'd say this goes well with sunshine and a chilled glass of Manzanilla sherry
