	That is no country for old men. The young 
	In one another's arms, birds in the trees, 
	—Those dying generations—at their song, 
	The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, 
	Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long 
	Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. 
	Caught in that sensual music all neglect 
	Monuments of unageing intellect.
	
*Sailing to Byzantium* **WB Yeats**

The name is a little bit tongue-in-cheek pretentious. This is a variation on classic eggs florentine. I find hollandaise sauce to be a little too heavy for my early morning tastes. This variation brings in the fragrant touches of middle-eastern zatar as well as the zingy sourness of sumac to give it a fresh feel.


Use the recipes for [garlic](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/garlic_oil/) and [onion](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/onion_oil/) and [porridge bread](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/porridge_bread/) presented elsewhere on this site. If you want to make this extra special match the porridge bread to the topping by putting paprika and oregano in the mix.

	250 g spinach
	1 teaspoon of fennel seed
	2 teaspoons zatar (thyme can substitute)
	2 teaspoons sumac 
	1 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon ground black pepper
	Juice of 1/2 lemon
	1/2 tablespoon of onion oil
	1/2 tablespoon garlic oil
	2 x fresh eggs
	4 slices of porridge bread
	Olive oil

	
* Put the onion and garlic oil in a frying pan over med/high heat.
* Add the fennel seeds and zatar.
* Cook for around 3 minutes stirring the mixture, be careful not to let the seeds burn.
* Add the spinach and stir until it has wilted as much as you want (probably takes 1 or 2 minutes).
* Take the spinach off, mix in the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Keep warm, or re-heat quickly in the microwave at the end.
* Toast the bread
* Poach the eggs - see section on [egg poaching](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/poached_eggs/)
* Assemble the dish
	* put the toast in the centre of the plate
	* pour a generous serving of olive oil over toast
	* add the spinach on top - leave a small nest in the centre for the egg
	* place the poached egg in the spinach
	* sprinkle sea-salt, cracked black pepper and the sumac over the top
