title: Onion

Onion is just as critical for cooking as garlic, maybe more so. It also suffers from the same fodmap incompatibility as garlic, because it is a plant root and stores many fructose sugars. And, just like garlic the solutions to using it in cooking are based in the extraction of the flavour into an oil.
