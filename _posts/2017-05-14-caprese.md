*After May* **Patrick Kavanagh**

Summer time calls for the fleeting pleasure of light salads in sunny gardens. There's not time or inclination to spend hours in a stuffy kitchen; what could be a more fitting meal than the simple, quick and full flavours of a Caprese salad. Creamy mozzarella, deep basil and fresh tomato combine in a dressing of complex earthy olive oil. 

Actually the best Caprese I have ever tasted was a Spanish twist on this - served in the excellent Bar AlfAlfa in Seville. There they used fresh oregano rather than basil, to give an Andalusian twist.

	1 beef heart tomato sliced - 1 cm thick
	2 lactose free mozzarella balls (125 g) sliced - 1/2 cm thick
	2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
	1 teaspoon sea salt
	1 teaspoon dried oregano
	1 teaspoon crushed black pepper 
	1 spring onion (green part only) chopped finely
	10 - 20 basil leaves
	
* Arrange the sliced tomato on a plate, leaving an empty patch in the centre.
* Place mozzarella slices over the tomato slices.
* Place the basil leaves over the mozzarella slices.
* The tomato, mozzarella and basil should form a fan pattern.
* Build up a mound of the remaining mozzarella, tomato and basil in the centre.
* Drizzle over with the olive oil.
* Sprinkle over the spring onion, salt, pepper and oregano.
