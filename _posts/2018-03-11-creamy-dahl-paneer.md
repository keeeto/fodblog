    It is raining in gusts but this storm
    cannot wash it away: 
    Guilt, like turmeric, stains the soul.

This recipe comes *via* a friend, Rav, from his father, the Doc. It uses toor dhal, which are an oily kind of lentil and results is a wonderfully creamy consistency of dhal. Other things that I learnt about from this recipe are Panch Pooran - a mixture of 5 seeds (cumin, fenugreek, black mustard, fennel and
nigella) which bring a wonderful aromatic edge to any dish - and tempering (vagar in Hindi) - a technique of releasing those aromas by quick cooking in very hot oil. In the video below I show the tempering process in this recipe. It is a fantastic technique and your kitchen will smell amazing for a long time afterwards. The paneer is my own addition, as I love paneer. Serve this dish with rice or naan - I hope to have a gluten free naan recipe up soon.

	1 cup red lentils
	1/2 cup toor dahl
	1/2 tablespoon ginger chopped fine
	1/2 teaspoon of turmeric 
	1 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon pepper
	3 tablespoons of tinned tomatoes
	2 teaspoons of sugar
	1 teaspoon of panch pooran (Indian 5 spice)
	4 or 5 cloves
	2 cinnamon sticks
	2 green and 2 black cardamom 
	2 tablespoons of garlic oil
	125 g paneer 
	1 tablespoon chopped coriander
	Juice of 1/2 a lime

* Wash the lentils
* Put the lentils in a saucepan with about 2 inches of boiling water (no need to be too accurate, we can add more later if needed)
* Add the ginger, turmeric, salt and pepper and keep boiling until the lentils are a bit pulverised (to your own tastes)
* Add the tomato
* Add the sugar
* Heat the garlic oil in a small saucepan until almost smoking
* Add in the panch pooran, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom
* The seeds start to crackle almost immediately
* Remove from the heat
* Throw the oil with the seeds and spices into the main saucepan of lentils
* Cook for a few more minutes
* Add the coriander and lime just before serving
