    * 1 tablespoon olive oil
    * About 500g of celeriac
    * 8 cloves of garlic

### Directions

* Preheat the oven to 190 C
* Chop the celeriac into 1cm slices and cut each garlic clove in half
* Coat the garlic and celeriac in oil and roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes (the celeriac should be just turning crispy on the outside)
* Meantime chop the onion and fry in the oil for 15 minutes over a medium heat, stirring to avoid burning - it should just be starting to caramelise at the end
* Add the potatoes and spice mix to the onion saucepan
* Fry for another 2 minutes
* Add  the stock cube and 1.2L water
* Bring to the boil and boil until the potato is softened (10 - 15 mins)
* Meantime pop all the garlic halves out of their skin and discard the skins
* Add the garlic and celeriac to the sasucepan
* Blend with a hand blender
* Serve
