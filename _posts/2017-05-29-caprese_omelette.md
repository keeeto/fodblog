	An omelette on the ... Ho! ho! ho! ho! ... 
	Omelette on the ...
	
*Ulysses* **James Joyce** [Bella Cohen, the madame of the brothel in Circe].

This is a lighter take on our usual denser brie based omelette. Using a caprese salad gives it a summer time feel, with fresh tomato and deep aniseed basil to wake you up.

The basic omelette recipe is [here](https://fodblog.github.io/2017/omelette/). Follow that recipe, with the 2 teaspoons of following filling.
